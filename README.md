My fonts
========

These are the font I've designed using mostly `gbdfed`.


sqaps
-----

This is my curent (2020) main everyday font.

It is a 5×7 pixels, square, small caps font.
I guess I could say it's opinionated?
It's unique anyways.

It contains:

- ASCII, of course
- latin-1
- latin extended A
- most of general punctuation
- most arrows
- some math operators
- rounded digits
- all line and box drawing chars
- basic shapes
- most misc symbols
- and more!


sqreep
------

This font started as a fork of [creep], but I ended up replacing most glyphs.
Only the braille pattern and maybe a few symbols remain for creep.

It's a monospaced bitmap font, with (almost) only vertical and horizontal lines.
This gives it a lovely square look, and kills silly diagonal pixels.

The character cell is 6×12 pixels.

It maps unicodes characters, including:

- all ASCII
- latin-1
- latin extended A
- basic (unaccented) greek
- most of general punctuation
- a few arrows
- some mathematical operators
- line and box drawing characters
- everything in misc symbols (why?)
- circled digits and a few more dingbats
- braille patterns from sqreep
- misc stuff in private area, also from sqreep
- ẞ, €, and more!

This is the first font I made for daily use.
I used it and enjoyed it for a while, before drawing **sqaps**.

3x6
---

A tiny monospaced, 3×6 pixels font.
Not exactly the most readable (especially for lat-1),
but I like to have such a font sometimes.

It includes:

- ASCII (first version was ASCII only)
- latin-1
- some general punctuation
- a few arrows
- a few math operators
- line and box drawing
- and more!
